# Reproducibility of Scientific Results in Software Engineering Research
This repository is used to save the 5 lab reports for the master seminar "Reproducibility of Scientific Results in Software Engineering Research" of WS2021 in LMU. 
\
The goal of this seminar is to learn how to use and assess artifacts from software engineering and programming language research.
\
The main tasks are performing a reproduction study on a given set of already published artifacts.
- verify that published research artifacts are still available and usable,
- read the related publications,
- follow the documentation of the artifacts to reproduce the studies’ results, and
- report the findings.
## Assigned papers and artifacts 
The following are the papers that were experimented on. Detailed lab reports are located in each subfolder and are named by their DOI numbers.
